I was given the basic setup for the maze game and had to work on the code to make everything run smoothly.
I created the Deep Q-learning code that lets the pirate agent learn to navigate the maze, make choices, and improve through experience replay and a target network.

Computer scientists design and build systems to tackle real-world issues using tech.
What they do is super important because it sparks innovation, improves how things work, and leads to solutions that really affect industries, healthcare, education, and entertainment.

When I face a problem as a computer scientist, I break it down into smaller steps, look at the data, try out different methods, and tweak things based on what I find.
For this project, I used reinforcement learning, allowing the agent to learn through trial and error, like piecing together a bigger puzzle.

My ethical responsibilities include making sure the systems I create are fair, safe, and transparent.
It's crucial to protect user data, avoid algorithmic bias, and ensure that what I build benefits both the organization and society without causing harm.
